# Rolldown Effect

## Core Idea
The rolldown effect is a bond investment strategy that captures capital gains by purchasing longer-maturity bonds and benefiting from yield curve positioning as time passes and the bond's effective maturity decreases.

## Context
This strategy is particularly effective in normal (upward-sloping) yield curve environments and is used by sophisticated bond investors to enhance returns beyond simple yield collection.

## Key Points
- Purchase bonds with longer remaining maturity at lower prices (higher yields)
- As time passes, bond effective maturity decreases, moving down the yield curve
- Bond price increases as it approaches shorter maturity, lower-yield levels
- Generates capital gains in addition to interest income
- Most effective in stable, upward-sloping yield curve environments
- Strategy assumes yield curve shape remains relatively constant

## Examples
- Buy 10-year bond yielding 3%, hold for 1 year, now 9-year bond yielding 2.8%
- Price appreciation from yield compression creates capital gains
- 3-6 month holding periods commonly used by institutional investors

## Implications
- Can provide total returns exceeding simple yield collection
- Requires yield curve stability for optimal performance
- Higher demand for optimal maturity points on yield curve
- Serves as cushion against moderate interest rate increases
- Risk-adjusted returns may be superior to buy-and-hold strategies

## Counterarguments
- Strategy fails if yield curve steepens or shifts upward
- Transaction costs can erode gains from frequent trading
- Requires accurate yield curve shape predictions
- Interest rate volatility can overwhelm rolldown benefits

## Applications
- Professional bond portfolio management
- Enhanced yield strategies for institutional investors
- Risk management during rising rate environments
- Optimization of duration exposure in bond portfolios

## Open Questions
- How do central bank yield curve control policies affect rolldown opportunities?
- What is the optimal holding period for maximizing rolldown benefits?
