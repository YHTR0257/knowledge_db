# Interchange Fee Revenue Model

## Core Idea
Interchange fees are transaction-based revenues that card-issuing banks receive from merchants for each debit or credit card transaction, creating a revenue stream aligned with customer spending rather than customer penalties.

## Context
Traditional banks generate revenue through fees charged to customers (overdraft, maintenance, minimum balance), while the interchange fee model aligns bank profits with customer transaction volume, creating economic incentives for customer success rather than customer failure.

## Key Points
- Merchants pay fees (typically 1-3%) to processing networks for each card transaction
- Card-issuing banks receive a portion of these interchange fees from the payment network
- Revenue scales directly with customer spending and card usage frequency
- Dodd-Frank Act allows banks under $10 billion in assets to charge higher interchange rates
- Creates natural alignment between bank profitability and customer financial activity

## Examples
Chime earns 72-80% of its revenue through interchange fees, generating income when customers use their Visa debit cards for purchases, with no direct fees charged to customers for basic banking services.

## Implications
- Enables "free" banking services funded by merchant payments rather than customer fees
- Creates strong incentives for banks to encourage customer spending and engagement
- Makes revenue vulnerable to economic downturns that reduce consumer spending
- Regulatory changes to interchange fee caps could significantly impact profitability
- Shifts banking from penalty-based to usage-based revenue models

## Counterarguments
Critics argue that interchange fees are ultimately passed to consumers through higher merchant prices, making the "free" banking model an illusion where costs are hidden in the broader economy.

## Applications
- Neobank business models (Chime, Current, Varo)
- Credit card reward programs funding
- Merchant payment processing services
- Embedded finance platforms
- Corporate expense management platforms

## Open Questions
- How sustainable are interchange fee rates under increasing regulatory scrutiny?
- Will merchant pressure lead to caps on interchange fees similar to European regulations?
- How do interchange fee economics change with the rise of digital payments and cryptocurrencies?
