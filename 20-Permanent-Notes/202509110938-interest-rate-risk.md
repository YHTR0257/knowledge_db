# Interest Rate Risk

## Core Idea
Interest rate risk is the potential for bond prices to decline when interest rates rise, representing the primary risk factor in fixed-income investing due to the inverse relationship between rates and bond prices.

## Context
Understanding interest rate risk is fundamental for bond investors, as it affects both individual security performance and overall portfolio volatility in changing rate environments.

## Key Points
- Bond prices move inversely to interest rate changes
- Longer maturity bonds have higher interest rate sensitivity
- Rising rates create capital losses; falling rates create capital gains
- Duration measures sensitivity to rate changes
- Cannot be eliminated, only managed through strategy
- Affects all fixed-income securities regardless of credit quality

## Examples
- 1% interest rate increase causes 10% price decline in 10-year bond
- New bond issuance at higher rates makes existing bonds less attractive
- Rate expectations drive bond trading more than current yields

## Implications
- Portfolio duration management becomes critical in volatile rate environments
- Timing of bond purchases matters significantly
- Rolldown strategies can provide some protection against moderate rate increases
- Diversification across maturities can reduce overall portfolio risk
- Active management may outperform buy-and-hold in rising rate periods

## Counterarguments
- Hold-to-maturity strategies eliminate price volatility concerns
- Rate changes often reverse over investment horizons
- Income from higher yields can offset capital losses over time
- Perfect rate timing is nearly impossible to achieve consistently

## Applications
- Bond portfolio duration management
- Asset-liability matching for pension funds and insurance companies
- Interest rate hedging strategies
- Market timing for bond allocation decisions

## Open Questions
- How do unconventional monetary policies change traditional interest rate risk patterns?
- What role does inflation expectations play in interest rate risk assessment?
