# Key Points

- A concept introduced in "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" (7つの習慣で語られたもの)
- Creating your own personal constitution and following its principles enables a meaningful and fulfilling life (自分だけの憲法を制定し、その原則に従うことで有意義で充実した人生を送ることができる)
- A mission statement serves as a compass for decision-making and prioritization throughout life
- It should be based on timeless principles rather than temporary circumstances or emotions

# Context

A mission statement is a foundational tool for effective living. In an age of constant distractions and competing priorities, having a clearly defined personal mission statement helps individuals stay focused on what truly matters. It acts as a filter for opportunities, relationships, and commitments, ensuring alignment between daily actions and long-term values. This concept is particularly valuable for knowledge workers and professionals who face numerous demands on their time and attention.

## Definition

A mission statement (ミッション・ステートメント) represents a personal constitution—a set of guiding principles and values that define who you are and who you want to become. It is not merely a list of goals but rather a philosophical foundation that informs all decisions and actions.

自分の中での憲法を意味する。個人の価値観、原則、目的を明確に定義した文書であり、人生の指針となるもの。

## Core Components

A well-crafted mission statement typically includes:

1. **Core values** (核となる価値観): Fundamental beliefs that guide behavior
2. **Life roles** (人生における役割): Key relationships and responsibilities (family, career, community, self)
3. **Long-term vision** (長期的なビジョン): Desired legacy and impact
4. **Guiding principles** (行動原則): Rules for decision-making and conduct

## Characteristics of Effective Mission Statements

- **Timeless** (普遍的): Based on enduring principles, not temporary circumstances
- **Personal** (個人的): Authentic to your values, not borrowed from others
- **Balanced** (バランスが取れている): Addresses multiple life dimensions (physical, mental, social, spiritual)
- **Inspiring** (鼓舞する): Motivates action and provides direction during difficult times
- **Concrete** (具体的): Clear enough to guide actual decisions
