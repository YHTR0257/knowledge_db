# Zero Coupon Bonds

## Core Idea
Zero coupon bonds are debt securities issued without periodic interest payments, where returns come entirely from capital appreciation as the bond trades at a discount to face value and matures at par.

## Context
Zero coupon bonds serve specific investment needs where lump-sum future payments are required, such as education funding or retirement planning, offering certainty of principal return at maturity.

## Key Points
- No periodic interest payments during bond life
- Purchased at discount to face value
- All returns realized as capital gains at maturity
- Higher interest rate sensitivity than coupon bonds
- Face value return guaranteed by issuer creditworthiness
- Ideal for matching specific future cash flow needs

## Examples
- $1000 face value bond purchased for $600, matures in 10 years at $1000
- Education funding where specific amount needed in 18 years
- Retirement planning with known future cash flow requirements

## Implications
- Eliminates reinvestment risk of periodic coupon payments
- Maximum interest rate risk due to no intermediate cash flows
- Tax implications may create current income recognition without cash flow
- Perfect for liability matching strategies
- Price volatility higher than equivalent coupon bonds

## Counterarguments
- No cash flow during holding period creates liquidity challenges
- High price volatility makes them unsuitable for risk-averse investors
- Tax treatment may create phantom income obligations
- Inflation risk affects real purchasing power of fixed maturity value

## Applications
- Education funding and savings plans
- Retirement planning with specific target dates
- Asset-liability matching for institutional investors
- Immunization strategies against interest rate risk

## Open Questions
- How do zero coupon bonds perform during extended inflation periods?
- What are optimal strategies for tax-efficient zero coupon bond investing?
